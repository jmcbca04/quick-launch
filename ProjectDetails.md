- Upload an image or select a background color.
- Choose a basic layout from a few pre-designed templates.
- Preview in real-time.
- Export as HTML or deploy to a subdomain (optional feature).

## Frontend: Building the User Interface
- **Page Builder Interface**  
  - Use a simple form where users input the required details (e.g., headline, button text).  
  - Add dropdowns or toggles for selecting fonts, colors, and layouts.
  
- **Live Preview**  
  - Dynamically update a preview panel as users enter text or change settings using real-time state management.
  
- **Template Selection**  
  - Offer a small set of pre-designed templates that users can toggle between.

## Backend (Optional for MVP)
You can build the MVP without a backend, but here’s when and why you might need one:
- **Hosting Custom Subdomains**: To manage deployments and subdomain configurations.  
- **User Accounts (Future Feature)**: To let users save and revisit their pages.

---

## File Generation
- **HTML & CSS Generation**  
  - Generate an HTML file with inline CSS or linked stylesheets after the user finalizes their design.  
  - Ensure the HTML is clean, responsive, and works out of the box.
  
- **Exporting**  
  - Provide a button for users to download the HTML file directly.

---

## UI & UX Simplification
- Keep the interface minimalistic:
  1. Step 1: Input Content (Text, Images).  
  2. Step 2: Choose Design (Template, Font, Colors).  
  3. Step 3: Preview & Export.
